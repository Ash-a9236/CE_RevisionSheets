<br>

________
### 01.00 FORM FACTOR

________
### 02.00 PROCESSOR SOCKET
________________

the CPU is attached to the motherboard, therefore it needs to fit the socket the motherboard has installed on

all processor sockets use ```ZIF``` or Zero Insertion Force sockets

on the market, today, most motherboards have three types of processor sockets

| ABV | FULL NAME | DESC |
|-----|-----------|------|
| ```PGA``` | Pin Grid Array | pins aligned in uniform rows around the socket|
| ```LGA``` | Land Grid Array | it uses pads (lands) rather than pins |
|```FCLGA``` | Flip-chip Land Grid Array | the chip is flipped so the top of <br> the chip makes contact with the socket |

<br>

to make contact with the CPU, the socket has two ways

| ABV | FULL NAME | DESC |
|-----|-----------|------|
| ```SPGA``` | Staggered Pin Grid Array | The pins are staggered over the socket <br> (which allows more pins to be put) |
| ```BGA``` |  Ball Grid Array | the CPU is soldered to the motherborad
